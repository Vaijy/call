Vaijy call #1
Date: 29 August 2014
Time: 16:00 CEST
Present: tarko, cmouse, ytti, job, samer, evan, teh
scribe: job
chair: ytti

Item 1: everybody open https://github.com/Vaijy/vaijy/wiki

ytti wants as little code as possible in release 0

teh adds: for release 0 'execution of external commands' should be includeda, added next to STOMP/AQMP

job proposes to scratch sms/email for rel0

for rel0 only MQ alert output, with at least one example consumer (smtp or fork)
for the MQ the preference lays with AMQP done with RabbitMQ

Times series data will be in influxdb, but nobody has experience with time
series database. http://influxdb.com/

For data models / config etc we prefer PostgresSQL

We will write our own SNMP poller, but is unclear what language the poller
should be in, maybe ruby is suitable for prototyping phase 

Separate triggered SNMP queries and scheduled/periodic SNMP queries?

For rel0 we use RabbitMQ for internal communication between the daemons, as 
backup plan we can use redis if AMQP does not scale. In any case we need a
persistent queue mechanism (MQTT therefor is unsuitable)

After an SNMP Trap comes in, a query can be triggered to collect additional
info from the device, but this info might never come back so we have to deal
with timeouts. Risk is that many many threads are required to accomodate this,
and fear is that ruby is not up to the task. cmouse will think about how to do
this.

Ytti seems to have a model in his mind of how alerts graduate, but issue seems to be
'how long do you wait before you decide _this_ is the alert that should be send'. 

job mentions that it would be interesting to have an ISIS daemon so the traps can 
be correlated with routing information coming in-band.

job proposes we do another call on 5 september at 16:00 CEST

Call ends at 17:00 CEST
